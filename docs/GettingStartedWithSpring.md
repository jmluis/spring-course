# Getting Started with Spring

In this exercise you will be introduced to the Java Programming Language.

## Aims

In this exercise, you will create a basic Spring application that uses a simple set of configured beans.

## Open the Starter Project and Review the Files
1.	Using your preferred IDE, open the project `<LAB_HOME>\labs\BasicSpring`.
2.	In the root directory of the project, open `pom.xml` (or build.gradle) and review the dependencies. You can see a dependency entry for Spring 5 Core. Close the file.
3.	Now navigate to the package `com.conygre.test.pets`.
4.	Review the classes that are provided. Note the relationships between `Pet`, `Cat` and `Dog`, and also the relationship between `Pet` and `Person`.

## Create the Configuration File
1.	Create a class in the same package as all the others called `PersonConfiguration`.
2.	In that class, add the annotation `@Configuration` to make it a configuration class.
3.	Now add in a method to configure a new `Cat`. The method must be annotated `@Bean` and simply needs to return a new `Cat` object. The return type must be `Pet`.

```
  @Bean
  public Pet pet() {
    return new Cat();
  }
```

4. Now add a method to configure the `Person`. This method is also annotated using @Bean, but this time, return a new `Person` that uses an injected `Pet` as a constructor parameter.

```
   @Bean
   public Person person(@Autowired Pet pet) {
       return new Person(pet);
   }
```

5.	Review the code and make sure that you understand what you have done.

Now we will create a test class that will be used to load the config file, load up the context, and then we will be able to access our beans,

6.	Open the provided class in the default package called  `PersonTest`.
7.	It has an empty `main()` method. Within `main()` add a line to create the context. It will look something like the below. Note you will also need to add the necessary import statements.

```
ApplicationContext context = new  AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(PersonConfiguration.class);
```

8.	That line creates all of the beans, and you can now look them up from within the context. So now, use the context to get the `Person` bean that was configured earlier and then get the `Pet` and finally feed the `Pet`. This can be done in one line as shown below:
```
context.getBean(Person.class).getPet().feed();
```
9.	Run the application, and after all of your efforts you will see. *“Feed the cat”.*

## Optional: Using the Annotations for configuration
Now create another similar pair of classes like Person and Address, and wire them together using the `@Component` annotation together with `@Autowired` to connect them.
You will have opportunity to use these later in the course if you don’t have time to complete this.


## Optional – Using XML for Configuration
Finally, if you have time, create an XML configuration file to wire together one of your pairs of beans from the previous exercises.
